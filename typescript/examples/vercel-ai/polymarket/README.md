# Vercel AI Polymarket Example

## Setup

Copy the `.env.template` and populate with your values.

```
cp .env.template .env
```

`POLYMARKET_API_KEY`, `POLYMARKET_SECRET` and `POLYMARKET_PASSPHRASE` will be populated in the next step.

## Usage

1. Create an API key for your wallet using Polymarket's API key creation tool

```
pnpm polymarket:api-key
```

2. Copy the API key response into the `.env` file

3. To use Polymarket you need to approve the exchange contracts to use your tokens (e.USDC or conditional tokens) so it can complete the trade on your behalf. This approval lets the exchanges move the tokens you’re using for buying or selling without needing your manual confirmation every time. It's like giving a trusted broker permission to handle the payment and delivery for a transaction you’ve already agreed to.

To approve the exchange contracts to use your tokens run the `setup-allowance` script.

```
pnpm polymarket:setup-allowance
```

4. Top up USDC.e to your wallet. **Important**, Polymarket uses USDC.e, not USDC. This is Bridged USDC on Polygon which is a different contract than USDC. If you top up USDC, you will get a "not enough funds" error. See contract [here](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x2791Bca1f2de4661ED88A30C99A7a9449Aa84174).

5. Run the script with your prompt!
```
npx ts-node index.ts
```
