## The OODA Loop: A Framework for Contribution

We believe in the power of the OODA Loop - a decision-making framework that emphasizes speed and adaptability. OODA stands for:

-   **Observe**: Gather information and insights about the project, the community, and the broader AI ecosystem.
-   **Orient**: Analyze your observations to identify opportunities for contribution and improvement.
-   **Decide**: Choose a course of action based on your analysis. This could be proposing a new feature, fixing a bug, or creating content.
-   **Act**: Execute your decision and share your work with the community.

## How to Contribute

1. **Create new plugins to support new protocols and onchain tools**

2. **Add support for new chains and wallet providers**

3. **Create tutorials for the community**

4. **Build agents and share them with the community**

### Steps
1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
    - The name of the branch should start with the issue number and be descriptive of the changes you are making (eg. 40--add-test-for-bug-123)
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. Ensure the test suite passes.
4. Make sure your code lints.
5. Issue that pull request!
